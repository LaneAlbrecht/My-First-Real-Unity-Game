# My-First-Real-Unity-Game
This was a game for a class in my early days of College. I had 2 other project teammates who I would tag if I knew their Github.

I only uploaded Scripts as they were the only things I really worked on outside of direct Unity Scene creation. Feel free to try out the game!
